# opensource-web-projects-with-xss
For web xss pentesters

Many website developers use code from popular opensource projects(directly or indirectly).
During my xss bug hunting, I frequently see some opensoure projects, whose old versions or current versions contain xss bugs, being used.
Here is a list of those projects:
1. zeroclipboard

3. flowplayer

4. player_flv_maxi.swf
